knoxpasswordlessdrf is a quick way to integrate ‘passwordless’ auth into
your Django Rest Framework project using a user’s email address or
mobile number only (herein referred to as an alias).

Built knox TokenAuthentication system, it sends the
user a 6-digit callback token to a given email address or a mobile
number. The user sends it back correctly and they’re given an
authentication token.

Callback tokens by default expire after 15 minutes.

Example Usage:
==============

```bash
curl -X POST -d “email=lijoev@gmail.com” localhost:8000/auth/email/
```

Email to lijoev@gmail.com:

```
...
<h1>Your login token is 815381.</h1>
...
```

Return Stage

```bash
curl -X POST -d "token=815381" localhost:8000/callback/auth/

> HTTP/1.0 200 OK
> {"token":"76be2d9ecfaf5fa4226d722bzdd8a4fff207ed0e”}
```

Requirements
============

- Python (3.6+)
- Django (2.0+)
- Django Rest Framework + AuthToken (3.6+)
- django-rest-knox (4.1.0)
- Python-Twilio (Optional, for mobile.)


Install
=======

1. Install knoxpasswordlessdrf

   ```
   pipenv install knoxpasswordlessdrf
   ```

2. Add Django Rest Framework’s Token Authentication to your Django Rest
   Framework project.

```python
 REST_FRAMEWORK = {
     'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES':
    ('knox.auth.TokenAuthentication',
 )}

 INSTALLED_APPS = [
     ...
     'rest_framework',
     'knox',
     'knoxpasswordlessdrf',
      ...
 ]
 REST_KNOX = {
  'SECURE_HASH_ALGORITHM': 'cryptography.hazmat.primitives.hashes.SHA512',
  'AUTH_TOKEN_CHARACTER_LENGTH': 64,
  'TOKEN_TTL': timedelta(hours=10),
  'USER_SERIALIZER': 'knox.serializers.UserSerializer',
  'TOKEN_LIMIT_PER_USER': None,
  'AUTO_REFRESH': False,
  # 'EXPIRY_DATETIME_FORMAT': api_settings.DATETME_FORMAT,
}
```

And run
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

3. Set which types of contact points are allowed for auth in your
   Settings.py. The available options are ``EMAIL`` and ``MOBILE``.

```python
PASSWORDLESS_AUTH = {
   ..
   'PASSWORDLESS_AUTH_TYPES': ['EMAIL', 'MOBILE'],
   ..
}
```

   By default drfpasswordless looks for fields named ``email`` or ``mobile``
   on the User model. If an alias provided doesn’t belong to any given user,
   a new user is created.

   3a. If you’re using ``email``, see the Configuring Email section
   below.

   3b. If you’re using ``mobile``, see the Configuring Email section
   below.

4. Add ``knoxpasswordlessdrf.urls`` to your urls.py

```python
 urlpatterns = [
     ..
     path('', include('knoxpasswordlessdrf.urls')),
     ..
 ]
```

5. You can now POST to either of the endpoints:

```bash
curl -X POST -d "email=lijoev@gmail.com" localhost:8000/auth/email/

// OR

curl -X POST -d "mobile=+15552143912" localhost:8000/auth/mobile/
```
   A 6 digit callback token will be sent to the contact point.

6. The client has 15 minutes to use the 6 digit callback token
   correctly. If successful, they get an authorization token in exchange
   which the client can then use with Django Rest Framework’s
   TokenAuthentication scheme.

```bash
curl -X POST -d "token=815381" localhost:8000/callback/auth/

> HTTP/1.0 200 OK
> {"token":"76be2d9ecfaf5fa4226d722bzdd8a4fff207ed0e”}
```

Configuring Emails
------------------

Specify the email address you’d like to send the callback token from
with the ``PASSWORDLESS_EMAIL_NOREPLY_ADDRESS`` setting.

You’ll also need to set up an SMTP server to send emails (`See Django
Docs <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/email/>`__), but for
development you can set up a dummy development smtp server to test
emails. Sent emails will print to the console. `Read more
here. <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/email/#configuring-email-for-development>`__

```python
# Settings.py
…
EMAIL_HOST = 'localhost'
EMAIL_PORT = 1025
```

Then run the following:

```bash
python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:1025
```

Configuring Mobile
------------------

You’ll need to have the python twilio module installed

```bash
pipenv install twilio
```

and set the ``TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`` and ``TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`` environment
variables.

You’ll also need to specify the number you send the token from with the
``PASSWORDLESS_MOBILE_NOREPLY_NUMBER`` setting.

Templates
=========

If you’d like to use a custom email template for your email callback
token, specify your template name with this setting:

```bash
PASSWORDLESS_AUTH = {
   ...
  'PASSWORDLESS_EMAIL_TOKEN_HTML_TEMPLATE_NAME': "mytemplate.html"
}
```

The template renders a single variable ``{{ callback_token }}`` which is
the 6 digit callback token being sent.

Contact Point Validation
========================

Endpoints can automatically mark themselves as validated when a user
logs in with a token sent to a specific endpoint. They can also
automatically mark themselves as invalid when a user changes a contact
point.

This is off by default but can be turned on with
``PASSWORDLESS_USER_MARK_EMAIL_VERIFIED`` or
``PASSWORDLESS_USER_MARK_MOBILE_VERIFIED``. By default when these are
enabled they look for the User model fields ``email_verified`` or
``mobile_verified``.

You can also use ``/validate/email/`` or ``/validate/mobile/`` which will
automatically send a token to the endpoint attached to the current
``request.user``'s email or mobile if available.

You can then send that token to ``/callback/verify/`` which will double-check
that the endpoint belongs to the request.user and mark the alias as verified.

Registration
============

All unrecognized emails and mobile numbers create new accounts by
default. New accounts are automatically set with
``set_unusable_password()`` but it’s recommended that admins have some
type of password.

This can be turned off with the ``PASSWORDLESS_REGISTER_NEW_USERS``
setting.

Other Settings
==============

Here’s a full list of the configurable defaults.

```python
DEFAULTS = {

    # Allowed auth types, can be EMAIL, MOBILE, or both.

    # The message sent to mobile users logging in. Takes one string.

    'PASSWORDLESS_EMAIL_VERIFICATION_PLAINTEXT_MESSAGE': "Enter this verification code: %s",

    # The verification email template name.
    'PASSWORDLESS_EMAIL_VERIFICATION_TOKEN_HTML_TEMPLATE_NAME': "passwordless_default_verification_token_email.html",

    # The message sent to mobile users logging in. Takes one string.
    'PASSWORDLESS_MOBILE_VERIFICATION_MESSAGE': "Enter this verification code: %s",

    # Automatically send verification email or sms when a user changes their alias.
